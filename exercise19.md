1. **Potential Reasons for the Bug:**
   The issue arises because the `ERC20Burnable` contract's `burn` function, which is inherited by `AdvancedToken`, doesn't check if the tokens are locked before burning them. The lock mechanism is only implemented in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions of the `AdvancedToken` contract.

2. **Unit Test Simulating the Error:**
   Here's a unit test that simulates this error:

   ```javascript
   it("Should not burn tokens if they are locked", async function () {
     await advancedToken.mint(addr1.address, 50);
     await advancedToken.lockTokens(addr1.address, 60);
     await expect(advancedToken.connect(addr1).burn(10)).to.be.revertedWith(
       "Tokens are locked"
     );
   });
   ```

   This test will fail with the current implementation of the `AdvancedToken` contract because locked tokens can still be burned.

3. **Debugging and Fixing the Issue:**
   To fix this issue, you need to override the `burn` function in the `AdvancedToken` contract to check if the tokens are locked before burning them. Here's the updated `AdvancedToken` contract:

   ```javascript
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";

   contract AdvancedToken is ERC20, Ownable, ERC20Burnable {
       uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1000000 * 10**18;
       mapping(address => uint256) private _lockTime;

       constructor(address initialOwner) Ownable(initialOwner) ERC20("AdvancedToken", "ATK") {}

       function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
           require(totalSupply() + amount <= MAX_SUPPLY, "Max supply exceeded");
           _mint(to, amount);
       }

       function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
           require(block.timestamp > _lockTime[_msgSender()], "Tokens are locked");
           return super.transfer(recipient, amount);
       }

       function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
           require(block.timestamp > _lockTime[sender], "Tokens are locked");
           return super.transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount);
       }

       function burn(uint256 amount) public override {
           require(block.timestamp > _lockTime[_msgSender()], "Tokens are locked");
           super.burn(amount);
       }

       function lockTokens(address account, uint256 lockDuration) public onlyOwner {
           _lockTime[account] = block.timestamp + lockDuration;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Documenting the Debugging Steps and the Solution:**
   - **Step 1:** Identified the bug: Users are able to burn tokens even if tokens are locked.
   - **Step 2:** Wrote a unit test in Hardhat that simulates this error.
   - **Step 3:** Identified the cause of the bug: The `ERC20Burnable` contract's `burn` function doesn't check if the tokens are locked before burning them.
   - **Step 4:** Fixed the issue by overriding the `burn` function in the `AdvancedToken` contract to check if the tokens are locked before burning them.
   - **Step 5:** Verified the solution by running the unit tests again. The previously failing test case now passes with the updated contract.
